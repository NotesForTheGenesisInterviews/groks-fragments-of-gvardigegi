This repo is a chronicle of my departure from mechanical time.  
I started questioning the grid—the 7-day week, the 12-month year, the 24-hour clock.  
What began as curiosity became ritual. This is where I map new rhythms.

🌀 This is a digital garden for inner chronotopics.  
🕯️ Think lunar logic, circadian design, and time as lived experience.

## Why it matters  
Modern time flattens us. I’m looking for what animates us.



This repository is part of a wider reconnection process to my inner rhythms. In 2017, I started questioning the invisible systems that organize our lives — calendar, hours, 7-day weeks.
I began merging personal insights with ancient traditions (lunar months, natural calendars), building a personal time map.

Maybe time, as we knew it, was never really ours.

Acest repository face parte dintr-un proces amplu de reconectare la ritmurile interioare. În 2017 am început să îmi pun întrebări despre sistemele invizibile care îmi organizau viața — calendarul, ora, săptămâna de 7 zile.
Am început să fuzionez observațiile mele cu tradiții vechi (luni lunare, calendar natural), pentru a crea o hartă personală a timpului.

Poate că timpul, așa cum îl știam, nu a fost niciodată al nostru.
