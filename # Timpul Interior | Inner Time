This repo is a chronicle of my departure from mechanical time.  
I started questioning the grid—the 7-day week, the 12-month year, the 24-hour clock.  
What began as curiosity became ritual. This is where I map new rhythms.

🌀 This is a digital garden for inner chronotopics.  
🕯️ Think lunar logic, circadian design, and time as lived experience.

## Why it matters  
Modern time flattens us. I’m looking for what animates us.
